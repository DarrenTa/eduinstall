      Linux computers handle security by having users with different roles.  Currently, you are logged in as your own account.  This account will let you use the computer like normal.  However, some actions may be limited.  For example, installing a program and connecting to a new wifi require more privileges.  Your account can activate these privileges by typing in your password.  You can also switch accounts to a root account which permanently has all privileges.  This computer has the same password for root, however that is not best practice from a security perspective.

    <p>
      To fully control this computer, you can learn how to use the command line.  The command line is accessed by clicking the icon at the bottom that looks like >_.  With a command line you can type commands to the computer.  ls is an example of a command that will list the files.  cd is a command that will change directories.  su will allow you to be a super user, and will switch to the root account after the correct password is supplied.  There is also a command ssh that will allow you to access other computers.
    </p>

    <p>
      ssh is a command that allows you to switch to another computer.  The other computer would need to be set up to allow you access.  There are many reasons you might want to access another computer.  For example, you might want to put a file on the web, or you might want to run a calculation remotely.  You might want to pull a file about website use.  Maybe the other computer has your email, etc.  If you are interested I can set up another computer for you to ssh to. I could also set this computer up so that you can put up webpages.  Web pages are often written in HTML or PHP.  HTML is a markup language, while PHP is an actual programing language that will allow a webpage to respond to user input.  For very advanced websites javascript is often used.

      Programing on This Computer
    </h2>
    <p>
    This computer is equipped with several programing languages.  Specifically this computer can run programs written in python2, python3, and C++.  Python2 and 3 are good for doing calculations, and is a higher level language.  A higher level language can do more with less programing.  C++ is a bit of a lower level language, this means that it provides more of a nuts and bolts control of the computer, which can take more time to program.  However, if done well C++ programs can be made to be more efficient.
    </p>
    <p>
    Python2 and 3 are similar languages but they are not compatible.  Generally, for a new project python 3 should be used.  To run a python 3 program what you can do is create a file with the program.  Python files usually end in .py but they don't need to.  To run the program on the command line, you would type "python3 filename.py" where filename.py is the file with the program.  Emacs can be used to edit python files as well as atom.  Both emacs and atom are installed on this computer.  These editors can color code your program so that it's easier to read.   
    </p>
    <p>
    To run a C++ program you would type the program in a file or files, and then type "g++ filename.cpp".  This will produce another file.  This other file can then be run by typing "./filename".  To run this file it must be also executable.  You can allow a file to be executable with the "chmod u+x" command.  This version of linux will show executable files in green when the list command of ls is received.

      If you have an interest in programing I recommend <A HREF="https://www.codecademy.com/">Code Academy</A>.  There you can learn HTML and JavaScript to make webpages.  You can also learn python.  There are also other languages that you can pay for pro access to. Also, a simple google search can answer many programing questions.

      What You Can Do is Open Ended
    </h2>
    <p>
      You can choose what you do.  The more you learn, the better you can control this computer.  You're only limited by what the hardware can do, and you can get new hardware.  If you have an interest, we can also learn about databases or other topics.  Happy Computing.
